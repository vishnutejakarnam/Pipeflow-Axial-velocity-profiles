# Pipeflow-Axial-velocity-profiles
A reproducible CFD project using ANSYS Fluent to study laminar pipe flow. Includes outlet axial velocity profiles for three meshes 100*5, 100*10 and 100*20 and velocity development at five axial locations with a fine mesh. Analytical comparisons highlight mesh dependence and flow development
